# The Jazz Theory Website

## Project Goal

<p>My goal for this project was to create a fun, interactive, easy to use tool practice tool for my saxophone and improvisation students. I included live saxophone, trumpet and trombone in the ear training section. Most ear-training apps use midi piano sounds, and I wanted to offer something different.</p>  

## Project Features

*<p>An instrument-specific Ear Training page that includes a random note sequencer</p>*
*<p>A theory page that includes "flash-card-like" questions and answers</p>*
*<p>A repertoire page where the student can choose a song list to work from</p>*
*<p>A Practice Routine page to help students organize their practice time</p>*

## Tech
