# The Jazz Theory Website

## Project Goal

My goal for this project was to create a fun, interactive, easy to use tool practice tool for my saxophone and improvisation students. I included live saxophone, trumpet and trombone in the ear training section. Most ear-training apps use midi piano sounds, and I wanted to offer something different.  

## Project Features

This project contains the following sections:
# An instrument-specific Ear Training page that includes a random note sequencer
# A theory page that includes "flash-card-like" questions and answers
# A repertoire page where the student can choose a song list to work from
# A Practice Routine page to help students organize their practice time

## Tech

This project was designed using Javascript, React, Reactstrap, CSS, Formik, and Logic Pro. It was deployed using Vercel.
